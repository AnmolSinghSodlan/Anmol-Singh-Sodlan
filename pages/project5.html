        <h1>Project Goal : Transforming Video Streaming with Chitr</h1>
        <p>
          The primary goal of the Chitr project is to revolutionize the video
          streaming experience, creating a dynamic and user-friendly platform
          that sets new standards for content exploration. Focused on providing

          the challenges prevalent on existing platforms.
          <br />

          <br />
          <br />
          Navigating through video streaming platforms can often be cumbersome

          Illustrator, and Photoshop were employed to develop detailed
          wireframes and prototypes. The commitment to refining color palettes,
          layouts, and visual elements played a vital role in crafting an
          intuitive platform that prioritizes optimal user experience.

          engaging video library. The meticulous implementation of Axios further
          reflected the commitment to providing users with a seamless experience
          during content exploration, playback, and interaction within the
          platform.

          <br />
          <strong> Dark Mode Implementation : </strong>
          <br />
          The implementation of Dark Mode involved a meticulous process,
          emphasizing flexibility and user control. CSS variables were
          strategically employed in the root stylesheet, allowing for
          centralized color management. Through JavaScript, these variables were
          dynamically modified, enabling users to switch between light and dark
          themes effortlessly. This dynamic approach not only facilitated a
          smoother transition but also reflected a commitment to a responsive
